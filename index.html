        <h1>Philadelphia <br>Fireplace Bar Map</h1>
        <p class="main">Let's help you find the best bar to check out in Philly with a fireplace.</p>
        <p>Mapped out are ALL the bars, but let's click over to the next slide and narrow things down a little based on Yelp reviews.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="slide2" style="display: none;">
        <h1 class="day-of-week">Filter by Stars</h1>
        <p class="main"> We can filter by stars on Yelp.
        </p> Select the minimum number of Yelp stars that you would like your bar to have. Ratings range between 1 and 5.
        <br>
        <br>
        Numeric filter:
        <br>
        <br>
        <input id="num1" type="number" name="num1" value="">
        <br><br><br><br>
        <button class="my-button">Plot Data</button>
      </div>
      <div id="slide3" style="display: none;">
        <h1 class="day-of-week">Which are the most popular?</h1>
        <p class="main">Great! Now that we've set the bar (get it?) let's filter the list further.</p>
        <p>Set the filter for the least number of Yelp reviews you want.  This will give you all the most popular bars.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Numeric filter:
        <br>
        <br>
        <input id="num2" type="number" name="num2" value="">
        <br><br><br><br>

        <h1 class="day-of-week">Great! Now Pick Your Bar</h1>
        <p class="main">Click on a bar to zoom in and see more.</p>
        <p> Go ahead and check out your filtered options.  After you've had an awesome time in from of the fire with a few beers check back in and click "Next" for the final slide.
        <br><br>
        (Make sure you have a filter filled in and submitted from the previous slide.)

      <div id="slide5" style="display: none;">
        <h1 class="day-of-week">How was it?</h1>
        <p class="main"> We've checked it off for you.</p>
        <p>
          Click on your bar again to check off some info on this fireplace.
          <br><br>
          Check off a little more info to let us know if this bar had the real deal, Wood, or just a placebo fireplace, Gas. We'll let everyone know!
          <br><br>
          (If it turns out there wasn't a firepace, check it off and we'll remove this guy from the map.)
